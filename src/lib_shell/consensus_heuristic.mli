(** {2 Consensus heuristic} *)

(** The consensus heuristic handles a heuristic to decide a consensus
   over one data. This data being asked to a remote peer. The set of a
   data and a peer is called a [candidate].

    The consensus heuristic is parameterized by two values:

    - [expected] which is the number of [expected] updates associated
   to [expected] different peers.

    - [threshold] which is required number of candidates to achieve a
   consensus.

   It is expected that [0 <= threshold <= expected < 2 * threshold] to
   ensure a consensus.  *)

type 'a t

type 'a state =
  | Consensus of 'a
  | No_consensus of 'a list
  | Need_more_candidates

(** The semantics of the heuristic is the following (assuming each
   update using a different peer):

   - If the heuristic received less than [threshold] updates then its
   state is [Need_more_candidates]

   - If the heuristic received more than [expected] updates and one
   candidate did not reach the [threshold] it returns [No_consensus]
   with the different candidates received. Otherwise, it returns
   [Consensus] with the candidate.

   - Otherwise, Either a candidate has reached the [threshold] and the
   state of the heuristic is [Consensus] with the candidate, or the
   state is [Need_more_candidates].

 *)

(** [create compare expected threshold ()] initializes the consensus
   heuristic. *)
val create :
  ?compare:('a -> 'a -> int) -> expected:int -> threshold:int -> unit -> 'a t

(** [get_state heuristic] returns the current state of the heuristic
   according to the semantics given above. *)
val get_state : 'a t -> 'a state

(** [update heuristic (peer, candidate)] updates the heuristic with
   the candidate [(peer, data)]. If a data was already registered for
   [peer], then it is erased by the update. *)
val update : 'a t -> P2p_peer.Id.t * 'a -> unit

(** {2 Consensus heuristic worker} *)

(** This worker aims to be used in the context where a consensus is
   required once in a while and where a consensus has to be
   reached. *)
module Worker : sig
  type 'a t

  (** [create name age_limit job restart_delay] creates the internal
     state of the worker.

   - [name] is the name of the worker.

   - [age_limit] is a promise which aims to be fulfilled when the
     current value of the consensus heuristic is too old (for example:
     [fun () -> Lwt_unix.sleep 150.]).

   - [job] is the task to be run and returns the state of the
     heuristic when the task is over.

   - [restart_delay] is a promise which is called if the state returns
     by the [job] is either [Need_more_candidates] or
     [No_consensus]. Then the promise [job ()] is run again. *)
  val create :
    name:string ->
    age_limit:(unit -> unit Lwt.t) ->
    job:(unit -> 'a state Lwt.t) ->
    restart_delay:(unit -> unit Lwt.t) ->
    'a t

  (** [wait worker] wait for a value for the consensus heuristic
     associated to the worker. If no consensus is found, the
     heuristic is run again. *)
  val wait : 'a t -> 'a Lwt.t

  (** [on_next_consensus worker hook] registers a hook to be executed
     on the next consensus value or the current one if there is a
     valid consensus ([Lwt.state (wait worker)] = [Lwt.Return hash]).

     Hooks are executed in the same order they are registered. *)
  val on_next_consensus : 'a t -> ('a -> unit) -> unit

  (** [on_all_consensus worker hook] registers a hook to be executed
     on every consensus value or the current one if there is a valid
     consensus ([Lwt.state (wait worker)] = [Lwt.Return hash]).

     It is guaranteed that a hook is executed exactly one time for
     each time that a consensus is reached. More precisely, between
     two executions of the same hook, the promise [age_limit ()] was
     run and fulfilled exactly once.  *)
  val on_all_consensus : 'a t -> ('a -> unit) -> unit

  (** [cancel worker] cancels the current task of the worker *)
