(** {2 Ranger} *)

(** The ranger module defines a generic worker to process abstract
   ranges. An abstract range aims to encode an interval [from; upto]
   . It is created from the two bounds of the interval.

   The ranger worker processes a sequence of ranges. For each range,
   the task is cut in two:

   - A task that can be parallelised called [parallel_task]

   - A task that needs to be run sequentially called
   [sequential_task].

   Each task may result into three different outcomes:

   - [task range = Some result]: The task operated successfully

   - [task range = Error err]: Such error is not recoverable from the
   worker, the worker is fulfilled with [Error err].

   - [task range = None]: The task failed but this is
   recoverable. Such recovery is delegated to the [recovery_task].  If
   [recovery_task = Error err]: No recovery is possible, the worker is
   fulfilled with [Error err]. If [discovery_task = Ok ()] then both
   the [parallel_task] and the [sequential_task] are run again.

   If one of these tasks is rejected, then the worker is rejected too.

   The worker splits the [range] into smaller ranges of size at most
   [max_range_size] (in reverse order if [reverse] is set to
   true). This list of ranges is computed lazily as a [range Seq.t].
   Then it folds over the sequence. For each [range], the worker
   allocates [tasks_in_parallel] slots. The worker feeds each
   available slot with a [parallel_task] with the next range
   available. The [sequential_task] is processed only when the
   [sequential_task] of the previous range is over. For the first
   range, the previous [sequential_task] is given by the [starts_with]
   parameter. The worker guarantees that there is at most one
   [sequential_task] which is run at the same time. *)

     [max_size]. Ranges can be sequenced in the reversed order if
     [reverse] is true. All the ranges are guaranteed to be non-empty.

(** An implementation of RANGE where bounds are Int32.t. The [split]
   function also rounds ranges. This way a range such as [3-35] with
   [max_range_size] is [10] and [reverse] is false gives the following
   sequence (represented as a list): [(3,10); (10,20); (30,35)].

   Rounding ranges have the property that except the first and last
   ranges, the bounds depends only on [max_range_size]. This gives
   more predictable ranges which eases the implementation of [tasks]
   which have side-effects (storing a range on the hard-drive for
   example). *)
